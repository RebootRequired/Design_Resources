What I thought :
1. Classes/objects - Lift, InternalRequest, ExternalRequest, Request, Scheduler
   Direction --> This is enum
   Lift 
     -id
     -Direction :up, down , idle --> can be implemented as enum
     -State : moving, idle, not working --> enum 
     -current floor
     - <processupjobs>
     - <processdownjobs>
     -initialize();
     
  ExternalRequest
    - Direction 
    - Source Floor
    
  InternalRequest  --> this could have natural sorting 
    - Target floor
    
  Request
    -Internal
    -External
    
  Scheduler
    - lift []
    - #floors
    - #elevators
    -initialize() -> this initializes the lift array
    - handleRequest(Request) : 1. assign closet lift to handle external lift 2. add to the respective job of the lift depending on direction
